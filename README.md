# Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Control System

## Overview
This project is a sophisticated simulation of traffic management for autonomous vehicles using the MQTT protocol. Developed in Java, it illustrates the coordination between autonomous vehicles and traffic control systems like traffic lights. This setup offers a simulated environment for exploring the interaction of smart city elements with autonomous transport.

## Key Components

### Red Light Switch
- Manages traffic lights by alternating signals, effectively controlling the flow of vehicle traffic.

### Traffic Light Service
- Observes traffic light states and manages vehicle behavior accordingly, ensuring compliance with traffic signals.

### Emergency Service
- Provides a mechanism to halt all vehicles instantaneously in response to emergencies, prioritizing safety.

### Light Display
- Visually represents the status of traffic lights, allowing for easy observation and monitoring.

### Ultimate Relay
- Acts as a central command center that processes and relays information to vehicles, integrating real-time traffic conditions and emergency responses.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to test and deepen the understanding of MQTT protocol, particularly its application in managing concurrent services and systems in a simulated autonomous vehicle environment. It demonstrates how MQTT can be used for effective communication and control in complex systems, reflecting potential real-world applications in smart city infrastructure and autonomous
