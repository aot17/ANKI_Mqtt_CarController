# Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Control System

## Overview
This project presents an innovative approach to managing traffic for autonomous vehicles using MQTT protocol. The system, built with Java and MQTT, orchestrates the interaction between autonomous vehicles and traffic control mechanisms like traffic lights. It simulates a smart city environment where each vehicle's movement is dynamically adjusted based on traffic signals and emergency situations, providing a glimpse into the future of urban mobility.

## Key Components

### Red Light Switch
- Controls traffic lights, alternating signals to manage vehicle flow.

### Traffic Light Service
- Monitors and responds to traffic light statuses, ensuring vehicles adhere to signals for safe and efficient travel.

### Emergency Service
- Allows immediate halt of all vehicles in urgent scenarios, enhancing safety measures.

### Light Display
- A visual representation of the current state of traffic lights for easy monitoring.

### Ultimate Relay
- The central hub that intelligently processes and relays commands to vehicles based on real-time traffic data and emergency signals.

## Objective
Through this project, we explore the integration of IoT and smart city concepts, demonstrating how technology can revolutionize traffic management and safety in an era of autonomous vehicles.
